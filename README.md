# ASIC-BASED-DPLL-FOR-CLOCK-SYNCHRONIZATION
This project implements an ASIC-based Digital Phase-Locked Loop (DPLL) using Verilog, featuring a loop filter, lock detector, and phase detector for precise clock synchronization. It is optimized for high-frequency operation and low power consumption, suitable for digital communication and signal processing.
